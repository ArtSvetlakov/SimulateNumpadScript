# SimulateNumpadScript
This script simulates Numpad keys if you can't use real Numpad for some reason. It was made in (and compiled with) AutoHotKey utility.

# How to use
1. Run "SimulateNumpad.ahk" (if you have installed AutoHotKey utility) or run "SimulateNumpad.exe" (standalone version of this script);
2. If green "H" showed up in system tray - script is working and you can use it;
3. List of hotkeys:
```
ALT + (0 - 9) = Numpad (0 - 9)
ALT + "/" = Numpad /
ALT + "-" = Numpad -
ALT + "." = Numpad .
ALT + Enter = Numpad Enter
ALT + Shift + 8 = Numpad *
ALT + Shift + "=" = Numpad +
ALT + Left Arrow = Numpad 4
ALT + Right Arrow = Numpad 6
ALT + UP Arrow = Numpad 8
ALT + Down Arrow = Numpad 2
```
# How to Compile
1. Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/releases);
2. Run AutoHotkey Dash -> Compile -> Agree with Ahk2Exe install (if not already installed);
3. In Ahk2Exe see "Main Parameters" Section -> in Source (script file) click "Browse" -> find "SimulateNumpad.ahk" and click "Open";
4. Click "Convert" and you will get "SimulateNumpad.exe" near the script in the same folder.
5. Then you can use "SimulateNumpad.exe" as a standalone application without having to install AutoHotkey utility.
